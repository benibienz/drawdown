# "The value for CONVENTIONAL Variable Operation & Maintenance (VOM) Cost is
# calculated per functional unit (i.e. per hour of operation). According to
# PJM (2011), VOM costs include expenses such as air filter replacements,
# inspections and overhauls, water treatment expenses, catalyst replacements,
# and major overhaul expenses. Given that these can occur in some cases over
# a number of years, the costs are divided by hours of operation to derive a
# cost per hour of operation, which is why these costs are reported in MWh.
# The MWh values for the IPCC minimum, median, and maximum VOM costs are input
# and then converted to kWh values. These figures on historical generation were
# collected from The World Bank Data in The Shift Project Data Portal
# (http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/Breakdown-of-Electricity-Generation-by-Energy-Source#tspQvChart).
# NOTE: the IPCC uses the following sources for calculating minimum, median,
# and maximum First Cost for coal and natural gas: 
#  Coal PC (Pulverized Coal): Black and Veatch (2012), DEA (2012), IEA/NEA (2010),
#    IEA (2013a), IEA-RETD (2013), Schmidt et al. (2012), US EIA (2013).
