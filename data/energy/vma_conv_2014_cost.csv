# The value for CONVENTIONAL First Cost is calculated by taking the weighted
# average of first cost values for conventional electricity generating
# technologies that will be directly replaced by the solution. The weight is
# the percentage share, for the given technology, of total global generatiion
# in 2014. These figures on historical generation were collected from The World
# Bank Data in The Shift Project Data Portal
# (http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/Breakdown-of-Electricity-Generation-by-Energy-Source#tspQvChart).
# NOTE: the IPCC uses the following sources for calculating minimum, median,
# and maximum First Cost for coal and natural gas:
# Coal PC (Pulverized Coal): Black and Veatch (2012), DEA (2012), IEA/NEA (2010),
#   IEA (2013a), IEA-RETD (2013), Schmidt et al. (2012), US EIA (2013).
# Gas Combined Cycle: Black and Veatch (2012), DEA (2012), IEA/NEA (2010),
#   IEA (2011),IEA (2013a), IEA-RETD (2013), Schmidt et al. (2012), US EIA (2013).
# NOTE: Lazard's LCOE Analysis Version 10.0 includes carbon capture and storage
# coal technology in its high estimate for costs, which is why these are not
# included.
