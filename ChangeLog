+ WIP change to move Visual Basic code out of the Excel file and into  
  external *.bas files, in https://gitlab.com/codeearth/drawdown/tree/excel_files
  Unfortunately after loading the basic code from external files, something
  in Excel seems to become corrupted and the spreadsheet can no longer be
  saved. It just gets an error.
  We'll work on figuring out why, until then the CL cannot go into the tree.
