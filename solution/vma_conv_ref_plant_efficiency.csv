# This variable creates a weighted average CONVENTIONAL Plant Efficiency by
# applying a weight to averaged plant efficiency data for coal and natural
# gas (see two variables below). The weights are based on the percentage, for
# the given technology, of total global generation. These values (TWh) are
# based on the IEA 2016 Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) scenario.
