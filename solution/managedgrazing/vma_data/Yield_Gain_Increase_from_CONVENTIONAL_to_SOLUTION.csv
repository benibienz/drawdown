Chinese grasslands are usually overgrazed. This measure considers a stocking rate reduction to a medium intensity. While the grassland condition is improving, the dry matter production of the grasslands would increase by 10%. The grassland utilization rate is reduced to 50% and thus the higher amount of organic material entering the soil will increase the carbon sequestration rate",

This measure considers a light grazing intensity on Chinese grasslands. As a result the grassland utilization rate is reduced to 35% and the dry matter production increases by 3%. Similar to L9, the carbon sequestration rate increases due to a higher organic matter input to the soil",
