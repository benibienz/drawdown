# For the IEA data, a lower heating value (LHV) is used. The average EIA data
# from 2004-2014 is reported in Btu/kWh, and this average is converted to an
# efficiency measure by dividing the equivalent Btu content of a kWh of
# electricity (which is 3,412 Btu) by the raw data input (see:
# https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=667&t=2). For the IPCC data,
# minimum, median, and maximum values are included.NOTE: the IPCC uses the
# following sources for calculating minimum, median, and maximum fixed annual
# opeartion and maintenance costs for coal and natural gas:
# Coal PC (Pulverized Coal): Black and Veatch (2012), DEA (2012), IEA/NEA (2010),
#    IEA (2013a), IEA-RETD (2013), Schmidt et al. (2012), US EIA (2013).
# Gas Combined Cycle: Black and Veatch (2012), DEA (2012), IEA/NEA (2010),
#    IEA (2011),IEA (2013a), IEA-RETD (2013), Schmidt et al. (2012), US EIA (2013).
