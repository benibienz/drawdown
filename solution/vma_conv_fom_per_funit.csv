# The value for Conventional Fixed Operation & Maintenance (FOM) Cost is calculated
# per implementation unit (i.e. per kW of installed capacity). FOM costs can include
# expenses such as day-to-day preventative and corrective maintenance, labor costs,
# asset and site management, and maintaining health and safety, among others. These
# figures on historical generation were collected from The World Bank Data in The
# Shift Project Data Portal
# (http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/Breakdown-of-Electricity-Generation-by-Energy-Source#tspQvChart)
# NOTE: the IPCC uses the following sources for calculating minimum, median, and
# maximum fixed annual opeartion and maintenance costs for coal and natural gas: 
#   Coal PC (Pulverized Coal): Black and Veatch (2012), DEA (2012), IEA/NEA (2010),
#      IEA (2013a), IEA-RETD (2013), Schmidt et al. (2012), US EIA (2013).
#   Gas Combined Cycle: Black and Veatch (2012), DEA (2012), IEA/NEA (2010),
#      IEA (2011),IEA (2013a), IEA-RETD (2013), Schmidt et al. (2012), US EIA (2013).
# NOTE: Lazard's LCOE Analysis Version 10.0 includes carbon capture and storage coal
#  technology in its ""high estimate"" for costs, which is why these are not included.
