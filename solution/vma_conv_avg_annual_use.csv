# The raw data input for Average Annual Use - Conventional is a capacity factor
# value that is converted to average annual use (TWh/TW/) by multiplying capacity
# factor by total hours/year (8760). A weight is then applied in order to create
# a weighted average value for all conventional sources that will be replaced by
# this solution. The weight is the percentage share, for the given technology, of
# total global generation. These figures on historical generation were collected
# from The World Bank Data in The Shift Project Data Portal
# (http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/Breakdown-of-Electricity-Generation-by-Energy-Source#tspQvChart).
