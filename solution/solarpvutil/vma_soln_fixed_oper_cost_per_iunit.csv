# The value for SOLUTION Fixed Operation & Maintenance (FOM) Cost is calculated
# per implementation unit (i.e. per kW of installed capacity). FOM costs can
# include expenses such as day-to-day preventative and corrective maintenance,
# labor costs, asset and site management, and maintaining health and safety,
# among others. NOTE: Utility-scale solar PV does not incur any variable
# operation and maintenance costs, so FOM are the only costs associated with
# the SOLUTION other than First Cost.
