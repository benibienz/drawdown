# These values show lifecycle GHG emissions for a range of different photovoltaic
# technologies (both thin-film and crystalline-Si) across different regions and
# system sizes, though all data are for ground-mount, utility-scale PV systems.
# Each row (excluding the data point from the IPCC) shows an average of different
# lifecycle indirect emissions estimates from several sources. The
# "Lifecycle indirect CO2 emissions per functional unit by PV type" VMA shows
# the data points from the literature that are used to calculate the averages
# seen here. See below for more detailed reference/source information for these
# entries. Each entry (except for the IPCC input) is weighted based on the total
# share of global PV production for each type of technology. These weights come
# from Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems and Projects in Solar Energy
# AG (2016).
