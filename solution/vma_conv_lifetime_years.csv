# The value for Lifetime Capacity - Conventional is calculated by taking the weighted
# average of lifetime capacity values (kWh/kW) for conventional electricity generating
# technologies that will be directly replaced by the solution. Raw data inputs in
# years are converted to kWh/kW by multiplying by the Average Annual Use - Conventional
# variable. The weight is the percentage share, for the given technology, of total
# global generation. These figures on historical generation were collected from
# The World Bank Data in The Shift Project Data Portal
# (http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/Breakdown-of-Electricity-Generation-by-Energy-Source#tspQvChart).
# NOTE: the IPCC uses the following sources for Lifetime Capacity for coal and natural gas:
#   Coal PC (Pulverized Coal): Black and Veatch (2012), DEA (2012), IEA/NEA (2010),
#     IEA (2013a), IEA-RETD (2013), Schmidt et al. (2012), US EIA (2013).
#   Gas Combined Cycle: Black and Veatch (2012), DEA (2012), IEA/NEA (2010),
#     IEA (2011),IEA (2013a), IEA-RETD (2013), Schmidt et al. (2012), US EIA (2013).
